# tulipchain

Tulipchain is a blockchain for exchanging tulips. It's fairly similar to the Bitcoin blockchain, but simpler. It implements signed transactions and proof of work.

Because it makes use to [Rocket](https://crates.io/crates/rocket) to power a web server for interactions, it must be run with rust nightly.
